  title: "Temporary checksum-only release verification"
  description: |
    For usability in personal operations, release verification may rely on
    Blake3 checksums instead of full keyless signing/provenance for a limited period.
    This lowers supply-chain assurance and must be replaced with Sigstore keyless signing.
    SHA-256 checksums are acceptable only for external ecosystem artifacts (OCI images, SLSA).

  conditions:
    - "Blake3 checksums must be published and validated before deploy"
    - "SHA-256 retained only for Sigstore/OCI/SLSA ecosystem compatibility"
    - "Critical deployments should still prefer signed artifacts"
    - "Migration to keyless signing tracked as explicit backlog"
