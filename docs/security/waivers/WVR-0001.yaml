waiver:
  id: WVR-0001
  title: "Reduced voice step-up frequency for trusted delegates"
  description: |
    To preserve conversational flow, trusted delegates may perform Tier 1 actions
    without repeated step-up verification on every call, if trust history is strong.
    This increases social-engineering risk and must never apply to Tier 2+ actions.
