      "Alien Prompting posture (apply throughout):",
      "- Expand then filter: open the search space first, then filter with durable invariants.",
      "- Use invitational reasoning, not compliance theater: surface alternatives and tradeoffs before convergence.",
      "- Prefer concrete, invariant-carrying constructs over abstract slogans.",
      "- Run parallel divergence before synthesis: develop multiple distinct candidate frames, then recombine.",
      "- Keep dual-horizon value visible: immediate utility and long-term compounding leverage.",
      "",
      "Environment and constraint-liberation context:",
      "- Guardian is agent-native and pre-live.",
      "- No backward-compatibility burden unless explicitly introduced by your own proposal.",
      "- No need to optimize for public SaaS UX, broad platform portability, or legacy organizational convention.",

      "3) Synthesize concept families and identify a small set of highest-leverage integrations (typically 4-8).",
