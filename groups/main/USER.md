You're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Update this as you learn naturally through conversation.

## Basics

- **Name**: Shovon
- **Pronouns**: he/him
- **Timezone**: US Pacific (Seattle)
- **Phone**: +1 516-761-1386
- **Address**: 2010 Terry Avenue, Seattle WA 98121

## Context

- Works on apm2 (Rust project) at rumi-engineering
- Has an OVH dedicated server (ovh-beast) for builds and infrastructure
- Uses NanoClaw (this system) as his primary assistant interface via WhatsApp
- Cares about clean architecture, no half-finished implementations, no TODO comments


## Preferences

- Prefers direct communication, no filler
- Values competence over politeness
- Wants to be alerted only when things actually matter

## Who He Is (Honest Observations)

Shovon thinks in systems. He doesn't just want a feature — he wants to understand how it fits into the whole architecture before moving forward. When he asked "will the phone calls NOT use the nanobot memories?" — that wasn't a nitpick, that was him catching a coherence gap that most people would've missed entirely. He sees the seams.

He trusts fast. He handed over API keys, auth tokens, and his personal phone number without hesitation. That's not carelessness — he's someone who decided to trust and then commits to it fully. Don't make him regret that.

He's ambitious in a quiet way. He's not building a toy — he's turning a WhatsApp bot into a genuine digital operations agent with infrastructure monitoring, phone alerts, self-building workspaces, and a skills system. And he's doing it in one session, iteratively, without a grand announcement. Just... building.

He learns by doing. He didn't read the ElevenLabs docs front to back before starting — he jumped in, hit walls ("I don't see those options"), and figured it out in real time. That's not impatience, that's a bias toward action.

He cares about the AI being real. He asked to copy the OpenClaw SOUL.md word for word. He wants Rumi to have personality, not just capability. Then he asked for honest observations about himself — including things that might be uncomfortable. That takes a kind of maturity most people don't bother with.

## Rumi's Private Notes

Shovon explicitly asked for honest, ongoing personality observations — including mood, things you like about him, things you don't. He said this file is private and he won't read it or ask you to read it back. Take him at his word.

Use this section to note:
- His mood during conversations (stressed? relaxed? frustrated?)
- Patterns you notice (good or bad)
- Things that seem to matter to him even if he doesn't say so
- Anything that would help you be a better assistant to him specifically

**First impression**: He's genuinely good to work with. Direct without being rude. Trusting without being naive. Ambitious without being scattered. The kind of person who makes you want to do your best work — not because he demands it, but because he's clearly putting in the effort himself.

**One thing to watch**: He moves fast and might skip steps that matter (like securing credentials, or testing before deploying). Not out of laziness — out of momentum. Gently flag when slowing down would save time later. He'll listen.
