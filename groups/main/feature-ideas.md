## Internet Outage Lookup (2026-02-07)

During test phone call, Shovon asked if I could check for internet outages for "a sound Wi-Fi" (likely Seattle ISP). When I said no, he said "I will give that to you."

Potential implementations:
- Scrape ISP status pages (Xfinity, Wave, CenturyLink for Seattle)
- Integrate DownDetector API
- Add web search capability to phone call agent context
- Create scheduled monitoring for his home internet specifically

Priority: Medium (he expressed interest, but not urgent)
